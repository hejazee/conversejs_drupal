This is a copy of converse.js library made for drupal

Original converse.js repository is here:
https://github.com/jcbrand/converse.js

But that repo, does not include the components folder.
So I've forked it here:
https://github.com/hejazee/converse.js
This is a fork of jcbrand's repo, but with components and node_modules folders.

The above repository is very large for download.
So I created this repository.
You can download necessary codes from here.
It's customized for drupal's conversejs.module.
