Important:
**********

This release includes support for [Off-the-record encryption](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca).
For this to work, your browser needs a CSPRNG (Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator).

Internet Explorer of all versions doesn't have one at all, neither does older versions of Firefox.

If you need to support older browsers, please download the latest release from the 0.6 bran

Features:
~~~~~~~~~

* Add a toolbar to the chat boxes [jcbrand]
* Add support for OTR (off-the-record) encryption [jcbrand]
* Add support for smileys [jcbrand]
* Simplified boilerplate markup [jcbrand]
* New configuration settings, ``xhr_custom_status_url`` and ``xhr_user_search_url`` [jcbrand]

.. note ::
    This release introduces a backward incompatible change. The boilerplate
    HTML needed in your webpage for converse.js to work has been reduced to a
    single div: <div id="conversejs"></div>
